### Working with Event Logs

An event log is the starting point for a process mining analysis.
In PM4JS, we offer a data structure to store event data.
The structure is implemented in the class [**EventLog**](./pm4js/objects/log/log.js).

The class **EventLog** contains the following properties:
* **traces**: an array containing Trace objects (the cases of the event log).
* **attributes**: a dictionary associating to an attribute name an Attribute object. This contains the attributes at the log level.
* **classifiers**: a dictionary associating to each classifier name the list of attributes that should be considered as classifier.
* **extensions**: a dictionary associating to each extension name the prefix and the URI of the extension.
* **globals**: a dictionary associating to each global scope a Global object.

The class **Trace** contains the following properties:
* **events**: an array containing Event objects (the events of a case).
* **attributes**: a dictionary associating to an attribute name an Attribute object. This contains the attributes at the case level.

The class **Event** contains the following properties:
* **attributes**: a dictionary associating to an attribute name an Attribute object. This contains the attributes at the event level.

The class **Attribute** contains the following properties:
* **value**: the value of the attribute.
* **children**: child attributes, each one of the Attribute class.

It is possible to iterate over a log object, and its properties, as follows:
for trace in log.traces:
> console.log(trace.attributes["concept:name"].value); // prints the case identifier (standard XES)

> for event in trace.events:

> > console.log(event.attributes["concept:name"].value); // prints the activity name (standard XES)

### Importing XES logs

[XES] is the current standard for the storage of event logs. A XES file is an XML file with a given structure. We can import the contents of a XES file in an **EventLog** object by doing:
**let eventLog = XesImporter.apply(xmlString);**
A practical example (using JQuery) to read a file located in **prova.xes** :

$.get("prova.xes", function(data) {
> let eventLog = XesImporter.apply(data);
> console.log(eventLog);
> 
});

### Importing CSV logs

Similarly to XES, also the importing of CSVs starts from the contents of a string.

**let eventLog = CsvImporter.apply(txtStri, 'sep', 'quotechar', 'case ID column', 'activity column', 'timestamp column');**

where:
* **txtStri** is the string containing the CSV to be imported.
* **sep** is the separator character (the character that splits the strings).
* **quotechar** is the quote character (allows for the separator inside the quote).
* **case ID column** is the column of the CSV that is the case identifier
* **activity column** is the column of the CSV that is the activity
* **timestamp column** is the column of the CSV that is the timestamp

A pratical example (using JQuery) to read a file located in **prova.xes** is the following (where the case identifier  column is **case:concept:name**, the activity column is **concept:name**, the timestamp column is **time:timestamp** ):

$.get("prova.csv", function(data) {
> let eventLog = CsvImporter.apply(data, ",", "\"", "case:concept:name", "concept:name", "time:timestamp");
> console.log(eventLog);
> 
});

### Exporting XES logs

An event log in PM4JS can be exported to a string representing a XES event log by doing:
**var xmlStri = XesExporter.apply(eventLog);**

### Exporting CSV logs

An event log in PM4JS can be exported to a string representing a CSV event log by doing:
**var csvStri = CsvExporter.apply(eventLog, 'sep', 'quotechar');**

Where:
* **sep**  is the separator character (the character that splits the strings).
* **quotechar** is the quote character (allows for the separator inside the quote).

A practical example follows:
**var csvStri = CsvExporter.apply(eventLog, ",", "\"")**
