### Working with Event Logs

An event log is the starting point for a process mining analysis.
In PM4JS, we offer a data structure to store event data.
The structure is implemented in the class [**EventLog**](./pm4js/objects/log/log.js).

The class **EventLog** contains the following properties:
* **traces**: an array containing Trace objects (the cases of the event log).
* **attributes**: a dictionary associating to an attribute name an Attribute object. This contains the attributes at the log level.
* **classifiers**: a dictionary associating to each classifier name the list of attributes that should be considered as classifier.
* **extensions**: a dictionary associating to each extension name the prefix and the URI of the extension.
* **globals**: a dictionary associating to each global scope a Global object.

The class **Trace** contains the following properties:
* **events**: an array containing Event objects (the events of a case).
* **attributes**: a dictionary associating to an attribute name an Attribute object. This contains the attributes at the case level.

The class **Event** contains the following properties:
* **attributes**: a dictionary associating to an attribute name an Attribute object. This contains the attributes at the event level.

The class **Attribute** contains the following properties:
* **value**: the value of the attribute.
* **children**: child attributes, each one of the Attribute class.

It is possible to iterate over a log object, and its properties, as follows:
for trace in log.traces:
> console.log(trace.attributes["concept:name"].value); // prints the case identifier (standard XES)
> for event in trace.events:
> > console.log(event.attributes["concept:name"].value); // prints the activity name (standard XES)
